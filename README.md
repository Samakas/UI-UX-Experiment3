# UI-UX-Experiment3

## Aim:

   To evaluate and compare the usability and user experience (UX) of two leading e-commerce mobile applications — Flipkart and Amazon — using Jakob Nielsen’s 10 Usability Heuristics. The goal is to identify strengths, weaknesses, and suggest improvements for enhanced user satisfaction and task efficiency.

## Algorithm:

1. Select competing apps: Flipkart and Amazon (Android/iOS).

2. Define key user tasks:

      Search for a product
      
      Browse categories
      
      View product details
      
      Add to cart and proceed to checkout .

 3. Apply Nielsen’s 10 usability heuristics :

      Visibility of system status
      
      Match between system and real world
      
      User control and freedom
      
      Consistency and standards
      
      Error prevention
      
      Recognition rather than recall
      
      Flexibility and efficiency of use
      
      Aesthetic and minimalist design
      
      Help users recognize and recover from errors
      
      Help and documentation

4. Rate severity (0–4) for each heuristic issue found.

5 Summarize findings and propose design recommendations.





| **Heuristic**                     | **Flipkart App**                                        | **Amazon App**                                         | **Suggested Improvement**                                                          |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Visibility of System Status**   | Clear loading animations and banners indicate progress. | Slight delay in updating cart and category refresh.    | Improve loading indicators in Amazon for better feedback.                          |
| **Match with Real World**         | Uses familiar icons and shopping language.              | Simple and intuitive icons.                            | Maintain consistent iconography and naming conventions.                            |
| **User Control & Freedom**        | Back navigation is clear; easy to cancel actions.       | Good navigation; fewer undo options during checkout.   | Add “Undo” or “Edit Cart” prompts during checkout (Amazon).                        |
| **Consistency & Standards**       | Consistent color scheme and layout.                     | Uses consistent patterns but some category icons vary. | Standardize icons and label hierarchy.                                             |
| **Recognition vs Recall**         | Visual product categories help recognition.             | Some text-based navigation requires recall.            | Add more visuals for quick recognition.                                            |
| **Aesthetic & Minimalist Design** | Bright, dense interface with bold banners.              | Clean, calm layout with ample white space.             | Flipkart could reduce banner clutter; Amazon can add contrast for section headers. |
| **Flexibility & Efficiency**      | Quick links (offers, grocery) speed up use.             | Saved items and recommendations improve efficiency.    | Add personalized quick actions to Flipkart.                                        |
| **Help & Documentation**          | Hidden under ‘Help Centre’.                             | Easily accessible help menu.                           | Bring help/support closer to main menu in Flipkart.                                |

## Result:
 
 Overall UX Ranking:
   1st: Amazon (more minimalist, consistent, intuitive navigation).
   
   2nd: Flipkart (visually engaging but slightly cluttered and information-heavy).
   
Key Observations:
  Flipkart attracts attention with bright visuals but may overwhelm new users.
  
  Amazon offers a calmer experience and better readability.

Recommended Improvements:

  Flipkart: Simplify home page layout, reduce banner size, add more whitespace, and emphasize essential actions.
  
  Amazon: Enhance visibility of active processes (e.g., cart updates), introduce color-coded sections for product categories.
